# 7 principles for button design

## Make buttons look like buttons

- Don’t assume that something in your UI is obvious for your users
- Use familiar designs for your buttons
    - Filled button with square borders
    - Filled button with rounded corners
    - Filled button with shadows [Most Useful]
    - Ghost button
- Don’t forget about the whitespace

## Put buttons where users expect to find them

- Use traditional layouts and standard UI patterns as much as possible
- Don’t play hunt-the-button game with your users

## Label buttons with what they do

- Button’s label should clearly describe its action
- Never designed a dialog box or form that consisted solely of the two buttons ‘OK’ and ‘Cancel’

## Properly size your buttons

- Prioritize buttons: Large Size or Contrasting Color
- Make buttons finger-friendly for mobile users [MIT Touch Lab study found that averages for finger pads are between 10–14mm and fingertips are 8–10mm. This makes 10mm x 10mm a good minimum touch target size.]

## Mind the order

- The order for buttons should reflect the nature of a conversation between the user and the system
- User interface is a conversation with your users

## Avoid using too many buttons

- Think about the most important actions you want your users to take

## Provide visual or audio feedback on interaction

- When users don’t have any feedback, they might consider that the system didn’t receive their command and will repeat the action. 
- For some options, it’s worth not only acknowledging user input but also show a current state of the process.

# 7 Practical Tips for Design

## Use color and weight to create hierarchy instead of size

- Try and stick to two or three colors
    - A dark (but not black) color for primary content
    - A grey for secondary content
    - A lighter grey for ancillary content
- Two font weights is usually enough for UI work
    - A normal font weight (400 or 500 depending on the font) for most text
    - A heavier font weight (600 or 700) for text you want to emphasize
    - Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work
    
## Don’t use grey text on colored backgrounds

Making the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy, not making it light grey

Text work with colorful background: 

- Reduce the opacity of white text, Use white text and lower the opacity
- Hand-pick a color that’s based on the background color [This works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern]

## Offset your shadows

Instead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset. It looks a lot natural.

## Use fewer borders

Instead using border to distinguish two elements from one another, try some more methods. Because too much borders makes your design feel busy and cluttered.

- Use a box shadow [more subtle and accomplish]
- Use two different background colors [Giving adjacent elements slightly different background colors]
- Add extra spacing [Spacing things further apart is a great way to create distinction between groups of elements]

## Don’t blow up icons that are meant to be small

Icons that were drawn at 16–24px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size.

If small icons are all you’ve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color, This lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size, while still filling the larger space.

## Use accent borders to add color to a bland design

It's a simple way to make your design more "designed"

## Not every button needs a background color

When designing actions, it’s important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.

- Primary actions should be obvious. [Solid, high contrast background colors work great here.]
- Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent. [Outline styles or lower contrast background colors are great options.]
- Tertiary actions should be discoverable but unobtrusive. [Styling these actions like links is usually the best approach.]
